# Code-to-read-a-String-value-using-Scanner-and-print-the-smallest-vowel-in-Java
Write main method in Solution class.  In the main method, write code to read a String value using Scanner and print the smallest vowel. Assume all input values are in lower case.  E.g If the input value is "matrix" then output will be a (since there are two vowels a and i where a is smaller as per ASCII sequence).
